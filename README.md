# Text To Speech In Python

A Text To Speech App

# Project Prerequisites
To implement this project, we will use the basic concepts of Python, Tkinter, gTTS, and playsound libraries.

Tkinter is a standard GUI Python library that is one of the fastest and easiest ways to build GUI applications using Tkinter.
gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) is a Python library, which is a very easy library that converts the text into audio.
The playsound module is used to play audio files. With this module, we can play a sound file with a single line of code.
